% The function TwoImp_min, computes the minimun total V two-impulse
% maneuvers, knowing the initial conditions of position and velocity of 
% Deputy w.r.t. target. To do this, the function considers a maximum final 
% time equal to half orbit period.   

% Initial conditions of position and velocity are given (by the user from 
% the keyboard) as components of two vectors (total of six parameters).
% After Clohessy-Wiltshire equations are solved to compute the minimum
% Delta_V and the corresponding time for the Deputy to reach the target.
