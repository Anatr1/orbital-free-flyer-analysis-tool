% HCW_IC_MakeFigs plots the spontaneous motion of Deputy respect to Chief
% in a planar orbit (2 dimensions), solving the HCW equations in cartesian 
% coordinates, given user-specified initial conditions on position and velocity.
% Five plots are obtained:

% 1. Motion for various x0 displacements

% 2. Motion for various x0_dot variations

% 3. Motion for various y0_dot variations

% 4. Motion for various x0_dot variations, x0 set  = 50 m

% 5. Motion for various y0_dot variations, x0 set  = 50 m



% The above_mentioned parmenters can be modified by the user, resulting in
% different behaviours by the Deputy, and thus in different curves in the
% graphs.Final time is arbitrarily set to 200 minutes in order to have figures
% as close as possible to the ones on the slides, but it can be chosen by the
% user as well
